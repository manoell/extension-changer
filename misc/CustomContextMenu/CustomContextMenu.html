<p>
CustomContextMenu is intended to make it easy to add your own menu items to the shell context menu
(the menu you get when you right-click a file or folder).
</p>

<p>
It is an abstract class which contains four methods you must override, in order to add
your menu items and execute them.
</p>



<a name='Howto'></a><h2>How To Use</h2>

<p>
To add your own menu items to the shell context menu you must create a DLL file.
This file is known as a <i>context menu handler</i> (or a <i>shortcut menu extension</i>).
</p>

<p>
Windows defines an interface, <a href='http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/shell/reference/ifaces/icontextmenu/icontextmenu.asp' target='_blank'>IContextMenu</a>,
which third-party developers can implement. Whenever Windows is about to show a shell context menu
it looks in the Registry to see if there are any DLLs that have been registered as context menu
handlers. If so, the registered handlers are then called. Windows provides them with the relevant
information, like which files are currently selected, and the handlers are expected to provide
(implement) the methods defined in IContextMenu.
</p>

<p>
Writing a context menu handler from scratch is tricky stuff, so I wrote CustomContextMenu
in order to encapsulate the basic details and let you concentrate on the essentials.
Here's how to use it:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a DLL project.</li>

<li>Add a unit containing a class (called TMyContextMenu, for instance) descended from
TCustomContextMenu.</li>

<li>In TMyContextMenu, override the four abstract methods, AddMenuItems, GetHelpText, GetVerb,
and ExecuteCommand. These methods are called when Windows needs information from you handler.
They are described in details below.</li>

<li>In the initialization part of your unit, call the method Initialize in order to
create an instance of your class when Windows calls your DLL.
As your context menu handler is a COM object, it needs a GUID in order to be identified
by Windows (a GUID is just a unique ID). You must call the Initialize method with this GUID,
and you must also register your DLL with the same GUID in the Registry.</li>

<li>How do you register your DLL in the Registry? There are several ways.
The most basic is a *.reg file. I prefer *.inf files, as they are more customizable.
Or you could use an install program. CustomContextMenu also comes with some stand-alone
registration methods you can use in an application (but not in the DLL itself).
</li>
</ul>

<p>
CustomContextMenu comes with a couple of demos. Take a look at them, and you will
probably quickly catch on. The CopyPath demo is the easiest one to understand.
</p>

<p>
I have provided *.inf files for the demos. They do more than simply registering the
corresponding DLLs, they also allow you to uninstall them again through the Control Panel.
Open one of the files, and at the bottom you'll find a number of constants you can substitute
with your own. Make especially sure the GUID matches the GUID found in your handler,
and remember the GUID must be unique for each handler (and everything else that is
registered).
</p>

<p>
The handler can be registered for different file types (so it will only be called if
the selected file is a *.txt file, for example). You can find these file types
in the Registry under the HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT key. Here are some common types:
</p>

<ul>
<li style='margin-bottom:0px'><b>*</b> - all files, but not folders or shortcuts</li>
<li style='margin-bottom:0px'><b>txtfile</b> - all *.txt files</li>
<li style='margin-bottom:0px'><b>exefile</b> - all *.exe files</li>
<li><b>Folder</b> - all folders</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you need to register your handler for a specific file type, look in the Registry
under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT. Say you want to register a handler for *.dpk files.
The default value for the HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.dpk key (dot dpk) is &quot;DelphiPackage&quot;.
That means you must specify &quot;DelphiPackage&quot; as the file type when you
register (or unregister) your handler. You can register the handler for multiple file types.
</p>

<p>
By convention context menu handlers should be installed in the folder ShellExt below the 
Windows System folder.

<a name='Properties'></a><h2>Properties</h2>

<table cellpadding='2' cellspacing='2' border='0' width='100%'>
<tr>
  <td class='name' valign='top'>FileNames</td>
  <td class='desc' valign='top'><span class='declaration'>property FileNames: TStringList;</span><br>
  When the context menu handler is initially called, Windows tells it what files or folders are 
  selected by the user. FileNames contains the fully qualified file names (complete path). 
  It can contain names of both files and folders.<br>
  <b>NOTE:</b> You can change the items in FileNames without problems (eg. remove the file names
  that don't match certain criteria, or sort the list alphabetically).</td>
  <td class='default' valign='top' nowrap><br></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class='name' valign='top'>FolderName</td>
  <td class='desc' valign='top'><span class='declaration'>property FolderName: String;</span><br>
  This property is the path of the folder containing the user-selected items.</td>
  <td class='default' valign='top' nowrap>Read-only</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class='name' valign='top'>ExtendedMenu</td>
  <td class='desc' valign='top'><span class='declaration'>property ExtendedMenu: Boolean;</span><br>
  This flag is true when the user holds down the SHIFT key while right-clicking a file or folder.</td>
  <td class='default' valign='top' nowrap>Read-only</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class='name' valign='top'>IdCmdFirstOffset</td>
  <td class='desc' valign='top'><span class='declaration'>property IdCmdFirstOffset: UINT;</span><br>
  This property stores the value of the IdCmdFirst parameter when the AddMenuItems method is called.</td>
  <td class='default' valign='top' nowrap>Read-only</td>
</tr>
</table>



<a name='Methods'></a><h2>Methods</h2>

<table cellpadding='2' cellspacing='2' border='0' width='100%'>
<tr>
  <td class='name' valign='top'>AddMenuItems</td>
  <td class='desc' valign='top'><span class='declaration'>function AddMenuItems(Menu: HMENU; MenuIndex, IdCmdFirst, IdCmdLast: UINT): UINT; virtual; abstract;</span><br>
  This method is called when the context menu is about to display. At this point you add
  your menu items.<br>
  <b>Parameters:</b><br>
  <i>Menu</i> is the context menu's handle.<br>
  <i>MenuIndex</i> is the current position in the context menu. You can insert your menu item(s)
  in another position if you like.<br>
  <i>IdCmdFirst</i> is the minimum possible ID your menu item(s) can have.
  Each menu item you insert must have a unique ID (as represented by TMenuItemInfo.wID).
  Without a proper ID your menu items will either fail to display, fail to execute, or even
  cause other menu items not to display. A good rule of thumb is to use IdCmdFirst as the
  first ID and then increment the ID for each additional menu item. This maximizes the
  potential number of menu items that can be added.<br>
  <i>IdCmdLast</i> is the maximum possible ID your menu item(s) can have.
  Typically there's a difference of about 100 between IdCmdFirst and IdCmdLast, and this
  number is shared between <i>all</i> menu items - so limit the number of menu items you insert,
  and use IdCmdFirst as a base for your IDs.<br>
  <b>Return value:</b><br>
  Your implementation of AddMenuItems must return the <i>highest</i>
  ID used by your menu items, or 0 if no menu items were inserted.<br>
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class='name' valign='top'>GetHelpText</td>
  <td class='desc' valign='top'><span class='declaration'>function GetHelpText(IdCmdOffset: UINT): String; virtual; abstract;</span><br>
  This method is called when a menu item is highlighted.
  It must return a descriptive text. This text is displayed in the folder window's status bar.<br>
  <b>Parameters:</b><br>
  <i>IdCmdOffset</i> is the ID of the highlighted menu item (which you specified in AddMenuItems) <i>minus</i>
  the original ID offset. In other words, if you inserted a menu item in AddMenuItems with an ID of
  IdCmdFirst, then IdCmdOffset will have a value of 0.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class='name' valign='top'>GetVerb</td>
  <td class='desc' valign='top'><span class='declaration'>function GetVerb(IdCmdOffset: UINT): String; virtual; abstract;</span><br>
  Like GetHelpText this method is called when a menu item is highlighted.
  A verb is a command that is registered for a particular file type. Common verbs are
  &quot;open&quot; and &quot;print&quot; (go to HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\txtfile\shell in the Registry 
  to see the verbs associated with *.txt files). It doesn't matter what you specify the verb
  to be, since verbs are only used by external programs that call the context menu's items.
  CustomContextMenu doesn't support external programs calling your custom menu items.<br>
  <b>Parameters:</b><br>
  <i>IdCmdOffset</i> is the ID of the highlighted menu item (which you specified in AddMenuItems) <i>minus</i>
  the original ID offset.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class='name' valign='top'>ExecuteCommand</td>
  <td class='desc' valign='top'><span class='declaration'>procedure ExecuteCommand(IdCmdOffset: UINT); virtual; abstract;</span><br>
  This method is called when the menu item is selected (clicked).
  Use it to run your own code.<br>
  <b>Parameters:</b><br>
  <i>IdCmdOffset</i> is the ID of the highlighted menu item (which you specified in AddMenuItems) <i>minus</i>
  the original ID offset.</td>
</tr>

<a name='StandAloneMethods'></a><h2>Stand-alone Methods</h2>

<table cellpadding='2' cellspacing='2' border='0' width='100%'>
<tr>
  <td class='name' valign='top'>Initialize</td>
  <td class='desc' valign='top'><span class='declaration'>procedure Initialize(ComClass: TComClass; ClassID: TGUID; ClassName: String);</span><br>
  You must call this method in the Initialization part of the unit that descends
  from TCustomContextMenu.<br>
  <b>Parameters:</b><br>
  <i>ComClass</i> is the class descended from TCustomContextMenu.<br>
  <i>ClassID</i> is the GUID specific to your handler.<br>
  <i>ClassName</i> is a class name for your handler. I believe the naming convention says 
  the name must not contain spaces, but the class name isn't really important unless you 
  expect other applications to identify your handler.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class='name' valign='top'>RegisterHandler</td>
  <td class='desc' valign='top'><span class='declaration'>RegisterHandler(ClassID: TGUID; Path: String; Description: String);</span><br>
  Registers your context menu handler in the Registry.
  You don't have to register it programmatically; you can also do it through an *.inf file
  or some other install script. Using this method in your context menu handler doesn't make
  sense (an unregistered handler can't register itself) - use it in an external application
  instead.<br>
  <b>Parameters:</b><br>
  <i>ClassID</i> is the GUID specific to your handler.<br>
  <i>Path</i> is the path to your handler (the DLL file).<br>
  <i>Description</i> is a description for your handler.<br>
  <b>NOTE:</b> You must also associate the handler with a file type. Use the RegisterFileType
  method for this purpose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class='name' valign='top'>UnregisterHandler</td>
  <td class='desc' valign='top'><span class='declaration'>UnregisterHandler(ClassID: TGUID);</span><br>
  Unregisters your context menu handler in the Registry.<br>
  <b>Parameters:</b><br>
  <i>ClassID</i> is the GUID specific to your handler.<br>
  <b>NOTE:</b> If you unregister your handler you should also call the UnregisterFileType
  method to remove the association to registered file types (provided you know these
  file types, of course).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class='name' valign='top'>RegisterFileType</td>
  <td class='desc' valign='top'><span class='declaration'>RegisterFileType(ClassID: TGUID; FileType, Name: String);</span><br>
  Associates your context menu handler with files or folders of a specific type. The handler
  can be associated with multiple types (call this method several times in that case).<br>
  <b>Parameters:</b><br>
  <i>ClassID</i> is the GUID specific to your handler.<br>
  <i>FileType</i> is the file type you want to register the handler for (as found in the
  Registry - eg. 'txtfile').<br>
  <i>Name</i> is the name your handler should be registered under.<br>
  <b>NOTE:</b> You must also register the handler itself. Use the RegisterHandler
  method for this purpose.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class='name' valign='top'>UnregisterFileType</td>
  <td class='desc' valign='top'><span class='declaration'>UnregisterFileType(ClassID: TGUID; FileType, Name: String);</span><br>
  Unassociates your context menu handler from files or folders of a specific type.<br>
  <b>Parameters:</b><br>
  <i>ClassID</i> is the GUID specific to your handler.<br>
  <i>FileType</i> is the file type you want to unregister the handler for.<br>
  <i>Name</i> is the name your handler is registered under.</td>
</tr>

<a name='Hints'></a><h2>Hints</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>My handler adds a menu item, but nothing happens when I select it?</b><br>
More than likely there's something wrong with the ID in the menu item you inserted.
Make sure you follow the directions mentioned for the AddMenuItems method.
</li>

<li><b>Can I create submenus?</b><br>
Yes, the context menu is a popup menu like any other.
</li>

<li><b>Can I create owner-drawn menu items?</b><br>
Yes, but you must use the OwnerDrawContextMenu class for this.
</li>

<li><b>Can I debug my handler?</b><br>
In Delphi you can specify a host application that runs your DLL (using Run|Parameters).
However, the context menu handler is called by explorer.exe, which is not suitable as a
host application. So, no, you can't - not as far as I know, anyway.
</li>

<li><b>Tell me more about context menu handlers?</b><br>
See <a href='http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/shell/programmersguide/shell_int/shell_int_extending/extensionhandlers/contextmenuhandlers.asp' target='_blank'>Creating
Context Menu Handlers</a>.
</li>
</ul>



<a name='Bugs'></a><h2>Known Bugs</h2>

<p>
WinME (and maybe also Win95 and Win98, please tell me) has a bug: If you attempt to install 
your DLL using an *.inf file, Windows will report it can't find the DLL if the DLL has a 
long file name (more than 8.3 letters). Using the &quot;Browse&quot; button in the dialog 
Windows presents makes no difference. So consider using a filename in the 8.3 format, if you 
intend to install your handler via an *.inf file.
</p>
